    Calculate the entropy score for a given distribution of classes.

    This method computes the normalized entropy of the class distribution
    in a partition. The entropy is normalized by the maximum possible
    entropy (uniform distribution) to get a score between 0 and 1.

    Args:
        row (pd.Series): A pandas Series containing the count of samples
                         for each class in a partition.
        num_classes (int): The total number of classes in the dataset.

    Returns:
        float: The normalized entropy score, ranging from 0 (completely
                   imbalanced) to 1 (perfectly balanced).

        Note:

    Compute the contribution level of a client based on its evaluation loss and dataset score.
    A higher gamma value assigns greater importance to the loss, while a lower gamma value places more emphasis on the dataset distribution.
